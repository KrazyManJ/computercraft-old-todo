<h1 align="center">ComputerCraft TODO</h1>

<p align="center">
	<i>Make your tasks to hit your eyes</i>
</p>

This was little one-night project to manage tasks inside my save of [Technic SSP](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/technic-ssp.1777938) Minecraft modpack.

I just wanted to share it here, so even my "fun programming" is shared with others.

Anyways, this script is for making todo list displayable on monitor of any size (kinda responsive). You run it on `startup` and then it automatically tries to find monitor to attach on. Then you can edit todo file after hitting enter. After save it immediatelly goes back to the script execution and updates displayed tasks on monitor.

## Config Example

```
--TO DO LIST CONFIG (kinda)

--put each task on new line = new line is separator of them
--also you can add those comments anywhere in file,
--just use double dash symbol combination (--).
